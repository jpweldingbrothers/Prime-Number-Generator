# Prime-Number-Generator
My 1st Program in Python3 (Generates Prime Numbers)

Still working on:
-Loping the Input to check for several prime factors
-writing the prime number list to a file
-reading the file back into the program
-testing the limits of data manipulation
-optimizing execution time

It's been 20+ years since I programmed in Fortran 77, feels like starting over

If you are just browing by - check it out and let me know how I did!
